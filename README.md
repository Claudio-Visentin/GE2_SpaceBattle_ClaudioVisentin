## Scene 1
![Scene 1](https://github.com/Claudio-Visentin/GE2_SpaceBattle_ClaudioVisentin/blob/master/Screenshots/Scene%201.png)
- The camera should follow the first spaceship and then pan out to show all of the four attacking spaceships.
- This scene is a great benchmark for the colour palette and lightning used thorough the clip.
- Everything in the action, while hectic, is always clear to the eye - viewers can see all spaceships at all time.

## Scene 2

- In this scene, we see the protagonists organising for the battle that just started, with the captain pushing onward.
- Since this is a live action scene, it could be implemented either in a very stylized fashion with different models, or as a clip playing in-between the spaceships battling.

## Scene 3
