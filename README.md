## Scene 1

- This scene is a great benchmark for the colour palette and lightning used thorough the clip.
- Everything in the action, while hectic, is always clear to the eye - viewers can see all spaceships at all time.

## Scene 2

- In this scene, we see the protagonists organising for the battle that just started, with the captain pushing onward.
- Since this is a live action scene, it could be implemented either in a very stylized fashion with different models, or as a clip playing in-between the spaceships battling.

## Scene 3
